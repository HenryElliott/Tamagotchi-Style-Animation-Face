# Tamagotchi-Style-Animation-Face
This project creates an animated face with eyes that blink and follow the mouse cursor. The eyes can randomly switch to a "dead" state, where an "X" replaces the eyes, adding an eerie touch. The blinking happens at random intervals and can be controlled through specific timing events.
